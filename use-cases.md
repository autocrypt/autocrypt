use cases:

**fatal loss of secrets use case**: Someone is sending me encrypted mail and my MUA permanently doesn't have access to the decryption secret and also not a revocation cert.

**temporary second device**: i don't have access to my usual MUAs,
only have webmail without access/support for mail encryption.
I'd like to receive and send (cleartext) mails without problems
and then, after turning to use my original device/MUA again, 
send encrypted mails without problems.

**inbome only on secondary device** I use webmail most of the time. But for a small subset of my communication i want to be able to use encryption (My friend said we need this). It should not mess with my other mails though.

**change to non-encrypting device**: i don't use an
encryption-supporting MUA anymore and want to receive/send mails without
problems with peers where messages were previously encrypted, however.

**setup first device/MUA**:  

**setup another device/MUA**:

**loss of one out of N devices**:

**compose mail**: i want to send a mail.

**compose encrypted mail**: i want to send an encrypted mail 
to someone.

**compose unencrypted mail**: i want to force my mail program to send unencrypted mail. 

**search in body of mails**: i want to search in mail bodies (independent of their encryptedness).

**validate keys**: i meet one of my peers and i want to be sure there is no / has not been an attack against our encryption.

**add a contact**: i meet someone who also uses encryption and want to start encrypted communication with them.

**deal with compromise**: i suspect my encryption is compromised.
