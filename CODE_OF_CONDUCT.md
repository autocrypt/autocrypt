# Autocrypt Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in the Autocrypt
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Showing empathy towards community members and newcomers
* Helping and mediating in cases of upsets or conflict

Please think twice, before you do something like this, as it may hurt people:

* Using sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other behaviour which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Maintainers and Responsibilities

Project maintainers are those with commit rights to the Autocrypt specification.
Each maintainer is asked to take responsibility and appropriate action in response
to witnessed instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project communication channels and
gatherings as well as in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting select project maintainers, currently azul@autocrypt.org
and compl4xx@autocrypt.org -- they are also often on the IRC #autocrypt channel
on freenode. They will review reports and involve other maintainers as appropriate,
resulting in a response that is deemed neccessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter
of an incident. They should as well believe a reporter, and respect their experience
and perspective.

Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct in good faith
may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
maintainers.
