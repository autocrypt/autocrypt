# Autocrypt Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers strive to making participation in the Autocrypt
community a pleasurable, harassment-free experience. 

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that we think contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Showing empathy towards community members and newcomers
* Helping and mediating in cases of upsets or conflict

Examples of behavior which we ask everybody to avoid include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other behaviour which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

We recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of
the impact of their behaviour. When that happens, you may carefully remind 
them in public or private, whatever is more appropriate. Assume good faith;
it's more likely that participants are unaware than that they intentionally
try to denigrade others or the quality of the discussion.

## Maintainers and Responsibilities

Project maintainers are those with commit rights to the Autocrypt specification.
Each maintainer is asked to take responsibility and appropriate, careful action 
in response to witnessed instances of questionable behavior.
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that violate "Our Standards" above. 
They may also ban temporarily or permanently a contributor for 
other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project communication channels and
gatherings as well as in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting and Responses

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting select project maintainers, currently azul@autocrypt.org
and compl4xx@autocrypt.org -- they are also often on the IRC #autocrypt channel
on freenode. They will review reports and involve other maintainers as appropriate,
resulting in a response that is deemed neccessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Maintainers are themselves not exempt from being reported about and may face
temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other maintainers.
