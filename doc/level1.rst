Autocrypt Level 1: Enabling encryption, avoiding annoyances
===========================================================

Autocrypt aims to incrementally and carefully replace cleartext e-mail
with end-to-end encrypted e-mail. This differs from the traditional approach
of maximizing the security of individual mail communications.
**Sometimes Autocrypt recommends to send cleartext mail even though
encryption appears technically possible.** This is because we want to
avoid unreadable mail for users. Users may mix both Autocrypt-capable
and traditional mail apps and they may lose devices or in other ways
the ability to decrypt in unrecoverable ways. Reverting to cleartext
when we suspect such situations is a key part of our aim to stay out of
the way of users.

Another major difference in approach is that Autocrypt Level 1 only
defends against passive data collection attacks. We share and support
:rfc:`the new perspective stated in RFC7435 ("Opportunistic Security: Some
Protection Most of the Time") <7435#section-1.2>`. Protection against
active adversaries (those which modify messages in transit) is the aim
of future specifications.

**Level 1 makes it easy for users to encrypt, based on an automatic and
decentralized key distribution mechanism. There are no dependencies on
key servers and it is meant to work with existing e-mail providers.**
Level 1 focuses on the use of Autocrypt on a single device. Users get
rudimentary support on using Autocrypt on more than one device or mail app.
This is internally realized through sending and receiving an Autocrypt
Setup Message, secured by manually entering a long number. Improving
usability for maintaining synchronized Autocrypt state on multiple
devices is the aim of future specification efforts.

**Last but not least, Level 1 is meant to be relatively easy for
developers to adopt.** It describes the basic capabilities required for
a mail app to be Autocrypt-capable at Level 1, allowing it to exchange
end-to-end encrypted e-mails with other Autocrypt-capable mail apps. The
spec contains detailed guidance on protocol, internal state and user
interface concerns. We have a good track record of supporting new
implementers. Please don't hesitate to `contact the group
<https://autocrypt.org/en/latest/contact.html>`_ or bring up issues or
pull requests. Autocrypt is a living specification and we envision
both bugfix and backward-compatible feature releases.

Terminology
-----------

Keywords to indicate requirement levels
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in the IETF's Best Current
Practice 14 (as defined in :rfc:`2119` and :rfc:`8174`) when, and only
when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Overview
--------

Approach and High Level Overview
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Autocrypt's primary goal is to automate both secret and public key
management so that users can encrypt mail without specialized
knowledge.

This specification adds an :ref:`Autocrypt-specific mail header
<autocrypt-header>` to outgoing mails, which contains, among other
information, the sender's :term:`public key`.  Transferring public
keys in-band means that key discovery in Autocrypt does not require
external infrastructure like OpenPGP keyservers or x509 PKI.

Autocrypt provides a :ref:`set of rules <update-peers>` that
tracks this information for each communication peer.  Autocrypt uses
this information to determine whether encryption is possible and makes
a :ref:`recommendation <recommendation>` about whether encryption
should be enabled for a given set of recipients.

This specification also introduces the :ref:`setup-message` as a way
to transfer secret key material and related settings to other e-mail
programs controlled by the same user.  This spec also provides
guidance on how and when to :ref:`generate <setup-message-creation>`,
:ref:`look for <getting-started>`, and :ref:`import
<setup-message-import>` these messages.

Autocrypt aggressively distributes public keys, but conservatively recommends
encryption to avoid disruption to established e-mail workflows.
Specifically, Autocrypt only recommends that an e-mail be encrypted if
encryption is possible, and:

1) The sender specifically requests encryption during message
   composition;
2) The e-mail is in reply to an encrypted message; or,
3) The sender and the recipients have explicitly stated that they
   :ref:`prefer <prefer-encrypt>` encrypted e-mail.


Requirements on MUA/E-mail Provider interactions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Autocrypt tries to impose minimal requirements on :term:`MUA` and
e-mail service interactions.  Specifically, an Autocrypt-capable MUA
needs to be able to:

- Control the contents of outgoing e-mail including the ability to set
  custom e-mail headers;

- Send e-mail on its own (required by the :ref:`Autocrypt Setup
  Message <setup-message>`);

- Read whole, raw e-mails including message headers; and,

- Optionally, scan the user's mailbox for mail with
  specific headers.

If a particular e-mail account does not expose one of the required
features (e.g., if it only exposes a javascript-driven web interface
for message composition that does not allow setting e-mail headers),
then the e-mail account cannot be used with Autocrypt.  An
Autocrypt-capable MUA may still access and control the account, but it
will not be able to enable Autocrypt on it.


Autocrypt Internal State
++++++++++++++++++++++++

An Autocrypt MUA needs to associate information with the peers it
communicates with and the accounts it controls.

.. _peers:

Communication Peers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each communication peer is identified by an e-mail address.  Autocrypt
associates state with each peer.  Conceptually, we represent this
state as a table named ``peers``, which is indexed by the peer's
:ref:`canonicalized e-mail address <address-canonicalization>`.

For the peer with the address ``addr``, an MUA MUST associate the
following attributes with ``peers[addr]``:

* ``last_seen``: The UTC timestamp of the most recent effective date
  (:ref:`definition <effective_date>`) of all messages that the MUA
  has processed from this peer.
* ``autocrypt_timestamp``: The UTC timestamp of the most recent
  effective date (the "youngest") of all messages containing a valid
  ``Autocrypt`` header that the MUA has processed from this peer.
* ``public_key``: The value of the ``keydata`` attribute derived from
  the youngest ``Autocrypt`` header that has ever been seen from the
  peer.
* ``prefer_encrypt``: The ``prefer-encrypt`` value (either
  ``nopreference`` or ``mutual``) derived from the youngest
  ``Autocrypt`` header ever seen from the peer.

Autocrypt-capable MUAs that implement :ref:`Gossip <key-gossip>` should
also associate the following additional attributes with
``peers[addr]``:

* ``gossip_timestamp``: the UTC timestamp of the most recent effective
  date of all messages containing a valid ``Autocrypt-Gossip`` header
  about the peer.
* ``gossip_key``: the value of the ``keydata`` attribute derived from
  the most recent message containing a valid ``Autocrypt-Gossip``
  header about the peer.

How this information is managed and used is discussed in :ref:`peer-management`.

.. _accounts:

Accounts controlled by the MUA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Level 1 MUA maintains an internal structure ``accounts`` indexed by
the account's :ref:`canonicalized e-mail address
<address-canonicalization>` (``addr``).  For each account controlled
by the MUA, ``accounts[addr]`` has the following attributes:

 * ``enabled``: a boolean value, indicating whether Autocrypt is
   enabled for this account.
 * ``secret_key``: The secret key material used for the account (see
   :ref:`secretkeys`).
 * ``public_key``: The OpenPGP transferable public key (:rfc:`OpenPGP
   "Transferable Public Key"<4880#section-11.1>`) derived
   from the secret key.
 * ``prefer_encrypt``: The user's encryption
   preference for this account.  This is either ``mutual`` or ``nopreference``.
   This SHOULD default to ``nopreference``.

If ``accounts[addr].enabled`` is ``true``, the MUA SHOULD allow the
user to switch the setting for ``accounts[addr].prefer_encrypt``.
This choice might be hidden in something like a "preferences pane".
See :ref:`preference-ui` for a specific example of how this could
look.

How this information is managed and used is discussed in :ref:`account-management`.

.. _peer-management:

Peer State Management
---------------------

An Autocrypt MUA updates the state it holds for each communication
peer using the e-mails received from that peer.  Specifically,
Autocrypt updates the state using the ``Autocrypt`` e-mail header.

.. _autocrypt-header:

The ``Autocrypt`` Header
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``Autocrypt`` header has the following format::

    Autocrypt: addr=a@b.example.org; [prefer-encrypt=mutual;] keydata=BASE64

There are three defined attributes:

 * The ``addr`` attribute is mandatory, and contains the single
   recipient address this header is valid for.  If this address
   differs from the one in the ``From`` header, the entire
   ``Autocrypt`` header MUST be treated as invalid.

   :rfc:`The Internet Message Format <5322#section-3.6.2>` documents
   three types of originator fields: ``From``, ``Sender``, and
   ``Reply-To``.  Autocrypt is concerned only with the ``From`` field,
   and ignores the other originator fields.

.. _prefer-encrypt:

 * The ``prefer-encrypt`` attribute is optional and can only occur
   with the value ``mutual``.  Its presence in the ``Autocrypt``
   header indicates an agreement to enable encryption by default with
   other peers who have the same preference.  An Autocrypt Level 1 MUA
   that sees the attribute with any other value (or that does not see
   the attribute at all) should interpret the value as
   ``nopreference``.

 * The ``keydata`` attribute is mandatory, and contains the key data
   for the specified ``addr`` recipient address.  The value of the
   ``keydata`` attribute is a Base64 representation of the binary
   :rfc:`OpenPGP "Transferable Public Key"<4880#section-11.1>`. For
   ease of parsing, the ``keydata`` attribute MUST be the last
   attribute in this header.

Additional attributes are possible before the ``keydata``
attribute.  If an attribute name starts with an underscore (``_``), it
is a "non-critical" attribute.  An attribute name without a leading
underscore is a "critical" attribute.  The MUA SHOULD ignore any
unsupported non-critical attributes and continue parsing the rest of
the header as though the attribute does not exist.  It MUST treat the
entire ``Autocrypt`` header as invalid if it encounters a "critical"
attribute that it doesn't support.

To introduce incompatible changes, future versions of Autocrypt may
send multiple Autocrypt headers, and hide the incompatible headers
from Level 1 MUAs by using critical attributes.  According to the
above rules, such headers will be judged invalid, and discarded by
level 1 MUAs.  Such an update to the specification will also have
to describe how an updated MUA will deal with multiple valid headers.

A MUA MUST NOT send an Autocrypt header above 10 KiB in size
(including the Autocrypt: prefix and folding whitespace).
Larger headers are likely the result of unintentionally bloated OpenPGP data.
To ensure a consistent failure mode across clients,
MUAs SHOULD treat such headers as invalid.

.. note::

  - An Autocrypt header following this specification
    will be up to 3 KiB in size.
    Some users might import 4096-bit RSA keys,
    which may result in an Autocrypt header of up to 5 KiB.
  - The 10 KiB limit was chosen to accomodate for these use cases
    but also avoid headers being truncated or emails being rejected
    by MTAs with a 10 KiB header size limit.


OpenPGP Based key data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``keydata`` sent by an Autocrypt-enabled Level 1 MUA MUST consist
of an :rfc:`OpenPGP "Transferable Public Key"<4880#section-11.1>`
containing exactly these five OpenPGP packets:

 - a signing-capable primary key
 - a user id
 - a self signature over the user id by the primary key
 - an encryption-capable subkey
 - a binding signature over the subkey by the primary key

The content of the user id packet is only decorative. By convention, it
contains the same address used in the ``addr`` attribute placed in angle brackets.
(This makes it conform to the :rfc:`5322` grammar ``angle-addr``.) For compatibility
concerns, the user id SHOULD NOT be an empty string.

These packets MUST be assembled in binary format (not ASCII-armored),
and then base64-encoded.

A Level 1 MUA MUST be capable of processing and handling Ed25519
public keys for signatures, as well as Cv25519 for encryption.  It MAY
support other OpenPGP key formats found in an Autocrypt header (for
example, by passing it agnostically to an OpenPGP backend for
handling).  In particular, it SHOULD support the RSA algorithm for
both signatures and encryption.

.. note::

  To optimize for compatibility, earlier versions of this document
  REQUIRED support for RSA, and recommended a 3072 bit RSA key
  configuration.  Support for elliptic curve cryptography in deployed
  OpenPGP implementations improved since then, and the switch to ECC
  was made in version 1.1 (January 2019) due to message size
  considerations.

Header injection in outbound mail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During message composition, if the ``From:`` header of the outgoing
e-mail (the ``from-addr``) matches an address for which
``accounts[from-addr].enabled`` is ``true`` and the Autocrypt-capable
MUA has secret key material (``accounts[from-addr].secret_key``), the
MUA SHOULD include an Autocrypt header.

This header MUST contain the corresponding public key material
(``accounts[from-addr].public_key``) as the ``keydata`` attribute, and
``from-addr`` as the ``addr`` attribute.  The most minimal Level 1
compliant MUA will only include these two attributes.  If
``accounts[from-addr].prefer_encrypt`` is set to ``mutual``, then the
header MUST have a ``prefer-encrypt`` attribute with the value
``mutual``.

The MUA MUST NOT include more than one valid Level 1 ``Autocrypt``
header (see :ref:`update-peers`).

If the ``From`` address changes during message composition (e.g., if
the user selects a different outbound identity), then the MUA MUST
change the ``Autocrypt`` header accordingly.

An MUA SHOULD send out the same ``Autocrypt:`` header in all messages
from a given outbound identity.  An MUA SHOULD NOT vary the header
based on the message's recipients. If (for whatever reason) the MUA
needs to update (or discovers an update of) the user's ``keydata`` at
some point, the MUA SHOULD send the updated ``keydata`` in all
subsequent ``Autocrypt`` headers.

See :ref:`example-headers` for examples of outbound headers and
the following sections for header format definitions and parsing.

..  _autocryptheaderformat:

Internal state storage
++++++++++++++++++++++

See :ref:`peers` for the information stored for each
communication peer.

Autocrypt MUAs keep state about each peer, to handle
several nuanced situations that have caused trouble or annoyance in the
past.  This state is updated even when the peer sends mail without an
``Autocrypt`` header.

For example, if a remote peer disables Autocrypt or drops back to
only using a non-Autocrypt MUA, we must stop sending
encrypted mails to this peer automatically.

In addition to the per-peer state described in :ref:`peers`,
MUAs MAY also store other information gathered for heuristic
purposes, or for other cryptographic schemes (see
`the Autocrypt website <https://autocrypt.org/en/latest/optional-state.html>`_
for some example ideas).

However, in order to support future synchronization of Autocrypt state
between MUAs, it is critical that Autocrypt-capable MUAs maintain the
state specified here, regardless of what additional state they track.

.. note::

  - An implementation MAY also choose to use keys from other sources
    (e.g., a local keyring) at its own discretion.
  - If an implementation chooses to automatically ingest a key from an
    ``application/pgp-keys`` attachment as though it was found in an
    ``Autocrypt`` header, it should only do so if the attached key has
    a :rfc:`User ID <4880#section-5.11>` that matches the message's
    ``From`` address.

.. _update-peers:

Updating Autocrypt Peer State
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Incoming messages may be processed to update the ``peers`` entry for
the sender identified by ``from-addr`` as extracted from the ``From``
header, by an MUA at receive or display time.

Messages SHOULD be ignored (i.e., ``peers[from-addr]`` SHOULD NOT be
updated) in the following cases:

  - The message is explicitly marked as auto-replied with an
    `Auto-Submitted: auto-replied` header (:rfc:`3834`).

  - The content-type is ``multipart/report``. In this case, it can be assumed
    the message was auto-replied. This avoids triggering a ``reset``
    state from received Message Disposition Notifications (:rfc:`3798`)
    which may not have `Auto-Submitted: auto-replied` header.

  - There is more than one address in the ``From`` header.

.. _spam-filters:

  - The MUA believes the message to be spam. If the user marks the
    message as not being spam the message MAY then be processed for
    ``Autocrypt`` headers.

When parsing an incoming message, an MUA SHOULD examine all ``Autocrypt``
headers, rather than just the first one. If there is more than one
valid header, this SHOULD be treated as an error, and all ``Autocrypt``
headers discarded as invalid.

Updating ``peers[from-addr]`` depends on:

.. _effective_date:

- the ``effective date`` of the message, which we define as the sending
  time of the message as indicated by its ``Date`` header, or the time
  of receipt if that date is in the future or unavailable.

  .. note::

     A message without a ``Date`` header, or with a ``Date`` that
     seems to be in the far future can cause problems for MUAs that
     encounter the message repeatedly (e.g. re-delivery, subsequent
     scans, etc). An MUA MAY decide to ignore such a message entirely
     for the purposes of Autocrypt processing.  If an MUA is capable
     of associating information with a received message, it could
     instead save the ``effective date`` of such a message the first
     time it sees it to avoid accidental re-processing.

- the ``keydata`` and ``prefer-encrypt`` attributes of the single valid
  ``Autocrypt`` header (see above), if available.

The update process proceeds as follows:

1. If the message's effective date is older than the
   ``peers[from-addr].autocrypt_timestamp`` value, then no changes are
   required, and the update process terminates.

2. If the message's effective date is more recent than
   ``peers[from-addr].last_seen`` then set
   ``peers[from-addr].last_seen`` to the message's effective date.

3. If the ``Autocrypt`` header is unavailable, no further changes are
   required and the update process terminates.

4. Set ``peers[from-addr].autocrypt_timestamp`` to the message's
   effective date.

5. Set ``peers[from-addr].public_key`` to the corresponding
   ``keydata`` value of the ``Autocrypt`` header.

6. Set ``peers[from-addr].prefer_encrypt`` to the corresponding
   ``prefer-encrypt`` value of the ``Autocrypt`` header.

.. _recommendation:

Provide a recommendation for message encryption
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On message composition, an Autocrypt-capable MUA
can decide whether to try to encrypt the new e-mail
message.  Autocrypt provides a recommendation for the MUA.

All Autocrypt-capable MUAs should be able to calculate the same
Autocrypt recommendation.

This recommendation algorithm provides sensible guidance that avoids
many common problems, and Autocrypt-capable MUAs SHOULD follow the
recommendation.  An implementation that deviates from the
recommendation should do so on the basis of specific external evidence
or knowledge, while carefully considering the impact of any variation,
including:

 * does it increase the chance of producing unexpectedly unreadable
   mail (for either the sender or the recipient)?
 * does it leak previously encrypted content in the clear?
 * does it force the user to confront a choice they do not have the
   information or knowledge to make safely?

If an implementation deviates from the Autocrypt recommendation in a
meaningful and useful way, the implementer should describe the
variation publicly so it can be considered for future revisions of
this specification.

Recommendation structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Autocrypt recommendation depends on the recipient addresses of the
draft message, and on whether or not the message is a reply to an
encrypted message.  When the user changes the recipients during
composition, the Autocrypt recommendation may change.

The output of the Autocrypt recommendation algorithm has two elements:

 * ``ui-recommendation``: a single state recommending the state of the
   encryption user interface, described below.
 * ``target-keys``: a map of recipient addresses to public keys.

``ui-recommendation`` can take four possible values:

 * ``disable``: Disable or hide any UI that would allow the user to
   choose to encrypt the message.  This happens iff encryption is not
   immediately possible.

 * ``discourage``: Enable UI that would allow the user to choose to
   encrypt the message, but do not default to encryption. If the user
   manually enables encryption, the MUA SHOULD warn that the recipient
   may not be able to read the message. This warning message MAY be
   supplemented using `optional counters and user-agent state
   <https://autocrypt.org/en/latest/optional-state.html>`_.

 * ``available``: Enable UI that would allow the user to choose to
   encrypt the message, but do not default to encryption.

 * ``encrypt``: Enable UI that would allow the user to choose to send
   the message in cleartext, and default to encryption.

Recommendations for single-recipient messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Autocrypt recommendation for a message composed to a single
recipient with the e-mail address ``to-addr`` depends primarily on the
value stored in :ref:`peers[to-addr] <peers>`.

Determine if encryption is possible
___________________________________

If there is no ``peers[to-addr]``, then set ``ui-recommendation`` to
``disable``, and terminate.

For the purposes of the rest of this recommendation, if either
``public_key`` or ``gossip_key`` is revoked, expired, or otherwise
known to be unusable for encryption, then treat that key as though it
were ``null`` (not present).

If both ``public_key`` and ``gossip_key`` are ``null``, then set
``ui-recommendation`` to ``disable`` and terminate.

Otherwise, we derive the recommendation using a two-phase algorithm.
The first phase computes the ``preliminary-recommendation``.

.. _`preliminary recommendation`:

Preliminary Recommendation
__________________________

If ``public_key`` is ``null``, then set
``target-keys[to-addr]`` to ``gossip_key`` and set
``preliminary-recommendation`` to ``discourage`` and skip to the
:ref:`final-recommendation-phase`.

Otherwise, set ``target-keys[to-addr]`` to ``public_key``.

If ``autocrypt_timestamp`` is more than 35 days older than
``last_seen``, set ``preliminary-recommendation`` to ``discourage``.

Otherwise, set ``preliminary-recommendation`` to ``available``.

.. _final-recommendation-phase:


Deciding to Encrypt by Default
______________________________

The final phase turns on encryption by setting ``ui-recommendation`` to
``encrypt`` in two scenarios:

- If ``preliminary-recommendation`` is either ``available`` or
  ``discourage``, and the message is composed as a reply to an
  encrypted message, or
- If the ``preliminary-recommendation`` is ``available`` and both
  ``peers[to-addr].prefer_encrypt`` and
  ``accounts[from-addr].prefer_encrypt`` are ``mutual``.

Otherwise, the ``ui-recommendation`` is set to
``preliminary-recommendation``.

Recommendations for messages to multiple addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For level 1 MUAs, the Autocrypt recommendation for a message composed
to multiple recipients, we derive the message's recommendation from
the recommendations for each recipient individually.

The aggregate ``target-keys`` for the message is the merge of all
recipient ``target-keys``.

The aggregate ``ui-recommendation`` for the message is derived in the
following way (the earliest matching rule encountered below takes
precedence over later rules):

1. If any recipient has a ``ui-recommendation`` of ``disable``, then
   the message's ``ui-recommendation`` is ``disable``.
2. If every recipient has a ``ui-recommendation`` of ``encrypt``,
   then the message ``ui-recommendation`` is ``encrypt``.
3. If any recipient has a ``ui-recommendation`` of ``discourage``,
   then the message ``ui-recommendation`` is ``discourage``.

Otherwise, the message ``ui-recommendation`` is ``available``.

While composing a message, a situation might occur where the
``ui-recommendation`` is ``available``, the user has explicitly
enabled encryption, and then modifies the list of recipients in a way
that changes the ``ui-recommendation`` to ``disable``. When this
happens, the MUA should not disable encryption without communicating
this to the user.  A graceful way to handle this situation is to save
the enabled state, and only prompt the user about the issue when they
send the mail.

.. _message-encryption:

Message Encryption
++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

   An e-mail that is said to be "encrypted" here will be both signed
   and encrypted in the cryptographic sense.

An outgoing e-mail message will be sent encrypted in either of two cases:

- the Autocrypt recommendation for the list of recipients is
  ``encrypt``, and not explicitly overridden by the user, or
- the Autocrypt recommendation is ``available`` or ``discourage``,
  and the user chose to encrypt.

When encrypting, the MUA MUST construct the encrypted message as a
:rfc:`PGP/MIME <3156>` message that is signed by the user's Autocrypt
key, and encrypted to the currently known Autocrypt key of each
recipient, as well as the sender's Autocrypt key.


Cleartext replies to encrypted messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the common case, a reply to an encrypted message will also be
encrypted. Due to Autocrypt's opportunistic approach to key discovery,
however, it is possible that keys for some of the recipients may not
be available, and, as such, a reply can only be sent in the clear.

To avoid leaking cleartext from the original encrypted message in this
case, the MUA MAY prepare the cleartext reply without including any of
the typically quoted and attributed text from the previous message.
Additionally, the MUA MAY include some text in the message body
describing why the usual quoted text is missing.  An example of such
copy can be found in :ref:`example-cant-encrypt-reply`.

The above recommendations are only "MAY" and not "SHOULD" or "MUST"
because we want to accommodate a user-friendly Level 1 MUA that stays
silent and does not impede the user's ability to reply.  Opportunistic
encryption means we can't guarantee encryption in every case.

.. _key-gossip:

Key Gossip
++++++++++

It is a common use case to send an encrypted mail to a group of
recipients. To ensure that these recipients can encrypt messages when
replying to that same group, the keys of all recipients can be
included in the encrypted payload. This does not include BCC
recipients, which by definition must not be revealed to other
recipients.

The ``Autocrypt-Gossip`` header has the same format as the
``Autocrypt`` header (see `autocryptheaderformat`_). Its ``addr``
attribute indicates the recipient address this header is valid for as
usual, but may relate to any recipient in the ``To`` or ``Cc`` header.
See example in :ref:`autocrypt-gossip-example`

The ``Autocrypt-Gossip`` header MAY also be used
to include keys for the address specified in the ``Reply-To`` header.
This allows replying encrypted even if the address differs from those in
the ``From``, ``To``, and ``Cc`` headers.

Key Gossip Injection in Outbound Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Autocrypt MUA MAY include ``Autocrypt-Gossip`` headers in messages.
These headers MUST be placed in the root MIME part of the encrypted message payload.
The encrypted payload in this case contains
one Autocrypt-Gossip header for each address.
Each header:

- MUST include an ``addr`` attribute that matches one of the
  addresses in the ``To``, ``Cc``, or ``Reply-To`` headers.

- MUST include the ``keydata`` attribute.
  For ``To`` and ``Cc`` headers it MUST contain the
  same public key which is used to encrypt the mail to the recipient
  referenced by ``addr``. See also :ref:`preliminary recommendation`
  for how this key is selected.
  For the address in the ``Reply-To`` headers
  it SHOULD contain the public key
  which the sender expects to be used for that address.

- SHOULD NOT include a ``prefer-encrypt`` attribute.

If a key has multiple user ids, only one SHOULD be contained in
``keydata``.  This user id SHOULD be picked to match the ``addr``
attribute, if possible.  This is only relevant for keys which came
from or were merged with data from external sources.

To avoid leaking metadata about a third party in the clear, an
``Autocrypt-Gossip`` header SHOULD NOT be added outside an encrypted
MIME part.

.. _key-gossip-update:

Updating Autocrypt Peer State from Key Gossip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An incoming message may contain one or more ``Autocrypt-Gossip``
headers in the encrypted payload. Each of these headers may update the
Autocrypt peer state of the gossiped address identified by its
``addr`` value (referred to here as ``gossip-addr``) in the following
way:

1. If ``gossip-addr`` does not match any address in the mail's
   ``To``, ``Cc``, or ``Reply-To`` header,
   the update process terminates (i.e., header is ignored).

2. If ``peers[gossip-addr].gossip_timestamp`` is more recent than the
   message's effective date, then the update process terminates.

3. Set ``peers[gossip-addr].gossip_timestamp`` to the message's
   effective date.

4. Set ``peers[gossip-addr].gossip_key`` to the value of the
   ``keydata`` attribute.

Message Drafts
--------------

During message composition, the user may want to close the dialog and
resume composition at a later point.  To preserve the session state,
messages are typically saved as "Drafts" in a special folder.
Messages from this folder may also be resumed from a different MUA.

To prevent the cleartext of a message draft from leaking to the
provider, the MUA can encrypt the draft message to itself (but not the
recipients) before uploading.  It MUST encrypt in this way if the
message is going to be sent encrypted, and SHOULD encrypt if the user
might decide to encrypt at a later point, or otherwise keep the draft
local only.  Drafts encrypted in this way SHOULD be stored in PGP/MIME
format.

A MUA SHOULD ignore the signature status of encrypted drafts, and
conversely encrypted drafts do not need to be signed.  This allows
storage of drafts independently from the user's secret key.

.. _autocrypt-draft-state:

Storing Draft State
+++++++++++++++++++

To store information about whether a message should be encrypted when
sent, an ``Autocrypt-Draft-State`` header MAY be added to the MIME
header of the draft message when it is stored.

The ``Autocrypt-Draft-State`` header consists of a list of attributes
with the same syntax as the :ref:`Autocrypt header<autocrypt-header>`
itself, which also supports critical and non-critical attributes
following the same semantics.  There are three defined attributes,
all of which have a binary value of ``yes`` or ``no``:

* The critical ``encrypt`` attribute specifies whether the message would
  be sent encrypted or not, at the time of saving the draft. It MUST
  be present in the header.
* The non-critical ``_is-reply-to-encrypted`` attribute indicates
  whether the message is composed as a reply to an encrypted message.
  This affects the :ref:`Autocrypt
  recommendation<final-recommendation-phase>`. It is optional and
  defaults to ``no``.
* The non-critical ``_by-choice`` attribute indicates whether the value
  of the ``encrypt`` attribute was made by immediate user choice. It is
  optional and defaults to ``no``.

Example::

    Autocrypt-Draft-State: encrypt=yes; _by-choice=yes;

The semantics of this header are defined only in the context of
a message that is loaded as a draft. It SHOULD NOT be processed for
messages loaded in any other context. It MUST be stripped from
a message before it is sent.

.. note::

    To minimize the amount of exposed metadata, it would be desirable
    to store this header in the encrypted payload of the message,
    rather than its outer envelope.  However, this causes technical
    difficulties in some MUAs, which is why it is left out here to
    optimize for interoperability.

Autocrypt Gossip headers for drafts
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When opening a draft that indicates it should be encrypted when sent
via the ``Autocrypt-Draft-State`` header, the resuming MUA might be
lacking keys for recipients that were originally available when the
draft was stored.

To solve this problem, a MUA MAY make use of the :ref:`key-gossip`
mechanism to include the keys of intended recipients in the draft
message. To do so, it simply places one ``Autocrypt-Gossip`` header
per recipient in the MIME header of the encrypted payload of the
draft.

Conversely, when opening a draft, a MUA MAY import keys from
``Autocrypt-Gossip`` headers that are present in the MIME headers of
the encrypted payload.  These headers should update the ``gossip_key``
and ``gossip_timestamp`` fields of the relevant peers `as
usual<key-gossip-update>`.

.. _account-management:

Managing accounts controlled by the MUA
---------------------------------------

See :ref:`accounts` for a definition of the structure of
information stored about the MUA's own e-mail accounts.


.. _secretkeys:

Secret key generation and storage
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The MUA SHOULD generate and store a Ed25519 plus Cv25519 secret key
for the user, the former for signing and self-certification, the
latter for decrypting.  The MUA MUST be capable of assembling these
keys into an OpenPGP certificate (:rfc:`RFC 4880 "Transferable Public
Key"<4880#section-11.1>`) that indicates these capabilities.

Secret key protection at rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The secret key material should be protected from access by other
applications or co-tenants of the device at least as well as the
passwords the MUA retains for the user's IMAP or SMTP accounts.

The MUA MAY protect the secret key (and other sensitive data it has
access to) with a password, but it SHOULD NOT require the user to
enter the password each time they send or receive a mail. Since
Autocrypt-enabled MUAs :ref:`sign all encrypted outgoing
messages<message-encryption>`, it could happen that the user has to enter
the password very often, both for reading and sending mail. This
introduces too much friction to become part of a routine daily
workflow.

Note that password protection of the secret key carries with it a risk
that the user might forget their password, which might result in
catastrophic data loss.  Unlike IMAP or SMTP credentials (which can be
reset by the server operator given some sort of out-of-band
confirmation), there is no recovery workflow possible for the loss of
a password protecting a secret key.  An MUA that chooses to offer
password protection of the secret key (or other sensitive data) SHOULD
support usable and secure backup/recovery workflows for the protected
material.

Protection of the user's keys (and other sensitive data) at rest is
achieved more easily and securely with filesystem-based encryption and
other forms of access control.


.. _multiaccounts:

Handling Multiple Accounts and Aliases
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An MUA that is capable of connecting to multiple e-mail accounts
SHOULD have a separate and distinct Autocrypt ``accounts[from-addr]``
for each e-mail account with the address ``from-addr``.

A multi-account MUA MAY maintain a single ``peers`` table that merges
information from e-mail received across all accounts for the sake of
implementation simplicity.  While this results in some linkability
between accounts (the effect of mails sent to one account can be
observed by activity on the other account), it provides a more uniform
and predictable user experience.  Any linkability concerns introduced by
Autocrypt can be mitigated by using a different MUA for each e-mail
account.

Sometimes a user may be able to send and receive e-mails with multiple
distinct e-mail addresses ("aliases") via a single account.  For the
purposes of Autocrypt, the MUA SHOULD treat each specific alias as a
distinct account.


Avoiding MUA Conflicts
++++++++++++++++++++++

If more than one Autocrypt-enabled MUA generates a key and then
distributes it to communication peers, encrypted mail sent to the user
is only readable by the MUA that sent the last message. This can lead
to behavior that is unpredictable and confusing for the user.


See section :ref:`getting-started` for guidance on how to detect and
avoid such a situation.


.. _`setup-message`:

Autocrypt Setup Message
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To avoid "lock-in" of secret key material on a particular MUA,
Autocrypt level 1 includes a way to "export" the user's keys and her
:ref:`prefer-encrypt state <accounts>` for other MUAs to pick up,
asynchronously and with explicitly required user interaction.

The mechanism available is a specially-formatted e-mail message called
the Autocrypt Setup Message.  An already-configured Autocrypt MUA
can generate an Autocrypt Setup Message, and send it to itself.  A
not-yet-configured Autocrypt MUA (a new MUA in a multi-device
case, or recovering from device failure or loss) can import the
Autocrypt Setup Message and recover the ability to read existing
messages.

An Autocrypt Setup Message is protected with a :ref:`Setup Code
<setup-code>`.

Message Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Autocrypt Setup Message itself is an e-mail message with a
specific format. While the message structure is complex, it is
designed to be easy to pack and unpack using common OpenPGP tools,
both programmatically and manually.

- Both the To and From headers MUST be the address of the user account.

- The Autocrypt Setup Message MUST contain an
  ``Autocrypt-Setup-Message: v1`` header.

- The Autocrypt Setup Message MUST have a ``multipart/mixed`` structure,
  and it MUST have as first part a human-readable description about
  the purpose of the message (e.g. ``text/plain`` or ``text/html`` or
  ``multipart/alternative``).

- The second mime part of the message MUST have Content-Type
  ``application/autocrypt-setup``, and SHOULD have Content-Disposition
  of ``attachment``. Its content consists of the user's ASCII-armored
  secret key, encrypted within an ASCII-armored OpenPGP
  symmetrically-encrypted message.  Specifically, this means a block
  delimited with ``-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----`` and ``-----END PGP
  MESSAGE-----``, which contains two OpenPGP packets: a
  :rfc:`Symmetric-Key Encrypted Session Key<4880#section-5.3>`
  followed by a :rfc:`Symmetrically Encrypted Integrity Protected Data
  Packet<4880#section-5.13>`.

- There MAY be text above or below the ASCII-armored encrypted data in
  the second MIME part, which MUST be ignored while processing. This
  allows implementations to optionally add another human-readable
  explanation.

- The encrypted payload MUST begin with an ASCII-armored :rfc:`RFC
  4880 Transferable Secret Key<4880#section-11.2>`. All trailing data
  after the first ASCII-armor ending delimiter MUST be stripped
  before processing the secret key. The ASCII-armored secret key
  SHOULD have an ``Autocrypt-Prefer-Encrypt`` header that contains the
  current ``accounts[addr].prefer_encrypt`` setting.

- The symmetric encryption algorithm used MUST be AES-128 or AES-256.
  The passphrase MUST be the Setup Code (see below), used with
  :rfc:`OpenPGP's salted+iterated S2K algorithm
  <4880#section-3.7.1.3>`.

.. _setup-code:

Setup Code
~~~~~~~~~~

The Setup Code MUST be generated by the implementation itself using a
`Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator>`_,
and presented directly to the user for safekeeping. It MUST NOT be
included in the cleartext of the Autocrypt Setup Message, or otherwise
transmitted over e-mail.

An Autocrypt Level 1 MUA MUST generate a Setup Code as UTF-8 string
of 36 numeric characters, divided into nine blocks of four, separated
by dashes. The dashes are part of the secret code and there are no
spaces. This format holds about 119 bits of entropy. It is designed to
be unambiguous, pronounceable, script-independent (Chinese, Cyrillic
etc.), easily input on a mobile device and split into blocks that are
easily kept in short term memory. For instance::

    9503-1923-2307-
    1980-7833-0983-
    1998-7562-1111

An Autocrypt Setup Message that uses this structure for its Setup Code
SHOULD include a ``Passphrase-Format`` header with value
``numeric9x4`` in the ASCII-armored data. This allows providing a
specialized input form during decryption, with greatly improved
usability.

As a further measure to improve usability, it is RECOMMENDED to reveal
the first two digits of the first block in a ``Passphrase-Begin``
header, sacrificing about 7 bits of entropy. Those digits can be
pre-filled during decryption, which reassures the user that they have
the correct code before typing the full 36 digits. It also helps
mitigate a possible type of phishing attack that asks the user to
input their Setup Code.

The headers might look like this::

    Passphrase-Format: numeric9x4
    Passphrase-Begin: 95

If those digits are included in the headers, they may also
be used in the descriptive text that is part of the Setup Message, to
distinguish different messages.

.. _setup-message-creation:

Setup Message Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Autocrypt MUA MUST NOT create an Autocrypt Setup Message without
explicit user interaction.  When the user takes this action for a
specific account, the MUA:

 * Generates a Setup Code.
 * Optionally, displays the Setup Code to the user, prompts the user
   to write it down, and then hides it and asks the user to re-enter
   it before continuing.  This minor annoyance is a recommended
   defense against worse annoyance: it ensures that the code was
   actually written down and the Autocrypt Setup Message is not
   rendered useless.
 * Produces an ASCII-armored, minimized :rfc:`OpenPGP Transferable Secret
   Key <4880#section-11.2>` out of the key associated with that account.
 * Symmetrically encrypts the OpenPGP transferable secret key using
   the Setup Code as the passphrase.
 * Composes a new self-addressed e-mail message that contains the
   payload as a MIME part with the appropriate Content-Type and other
   headers.
 * Sends the generated e-mail message to its own account.
 * Suggests to the user to either back up the message or to import it
   from another Autocrypt-capable MUA.

A Level 1 MUA MUST be able to create an Autocrypt Setup Message, to
preserve users' ability to recover from disaster, and to choose to use
a different Autocrypt-capable MUA in the future.

.. _setup-message-import:

Setup Message Import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Autocrypt-capable MUA SHOULD support the ability to find and import
an Autocrypt Setup Message when the user has not yet configured
Autocrypt (that is, when ``accounts[addr].secret_key`` is unset).  An
MUA in this state could look for such a message in several ways,
including:

 * If the user decides to enable Autocrypt for an account, and
   indicates to the MUA that an older MUA has already enabled
   Autocrypt on that account, the new MUA could ask the user to
   generate an Autocrypt Setup Message from the old MUA, and then wait
   (e.g., via :rfc:`IMAP IDLE <2177>`) for such a message to arrive.

 * The MUA could proactively scan the account's mailbox for a message
   that matches these characteristics, and it could alert the user if
   it discovers one.

When looking for an Autocrypt Setup Message, the MUA may encounter
messages that look similar to what it expects, but are not
well-formed.  If the MUA discovers an e-mail message that has the
``Autocrypt-Setup-Message`` header but its value is not ``v1``, the
MUA SHOULD ignore this message entirely.

When looking for an Autocrypt Setup Message, if the MUA discovers a
message with the ``Autocrypt-Setup-Message: v1`` header with ``To:``
and ``From:`` headers matching an account controlled by the MUA, but
the message's metadata and structure is not as expected, the MUA
SHOULD alert the user that a malformed Setup Message has been found,
and it SHOULD NOT offer to import the message.

If the MUA finds a good Autocrypt Setup Message, it should offer to
import it to enable Autocrypt.  If the user agrees to do so:

 * The MUA prompts the user for their corresponding Setup Code.
   If there is a ``Passphrase-Format`` header in the outer OpenPGP armor and
   its value is ``numeric9x4``, then the MUA MAY present a specialized
   input dialog assisting the user to enter a code in the format described
   above.
   If there is no ``Passphrase-Format`` header, or the value is unknown,
   then the MUA MUST provide a plain UTF-8 string text entry.

 * The MUA should try decrypting the message with the supplied Setup
   Code.  The Code serves both for decryption as well as
   authenticating the message.  Extra care needs to be taken with some
   PGP implementations that the Setup Code is actually used for
   decryption. For example, `this is difficult to do correctly with
   GnuPG <https://dev.gnupg.org/T3277>`_.

 * If it decrypts, then the MUA SHOULD update ``accounts[addr]``
   according to the contents of the decrypted message, as discussed in
   :ref:`accounts`.

See :ref:`setup-message-example`.

Since Level 1 only recommends looking for a Setup Message when
``accounts[addr].secret_key`` is unset, some Level 1 MUAs might not
look for or handle Setup Messages for an already-configured account at
all.  If two such MUAs share an account, and both MUAs have somehow
enabled Autocrypt on it independently without discovery of a Setup
Message, they will have different secret keys.  This situation is bad
because it may lead to intermittently unreadable mail on either or
both MUAs.

These simple implementations can both keep Autocrypt enabled and avoid
new unreadable mail if the user manually synchronizes secret keys.  To
do this, the user must first :ref:`destroy their local secret
key<destroy-secret-key>` on one MUA.  Afterwards, that MUA can begin
looking for a Setup Message again.  A more sophisticated
implementation may offer a more user-friendly way to detect this
situation and resolve it.

User Interface
--------------

Ideally, Autocrypt users see very little UI.  However, some UI is
inevitable if we want users to be able to interoperate with existing,
non-Autocrypt users.

Message Composition
+++++++++++++++++++

If an MUA is willing to compose encrypted mail, it SHOULD include some
UI mechanism at message composition time for the user to choose between
encrypted message or cleartext.  This may be as simple as a single
checkbox.

If the Autocrypt recommendation is ``disable`` for a given message,
the MUA MAY choose to avoid exposing this UI during message
composition at all.

If the Autocrypt recommendation is either ``available`` or
``encrypt``, the MUA SHOULD expose this UI with the :ref:`recommended default <recommendation>` during message composition
to allow the user to make a different decision.

If the Autocrypt recommendation is ``discourage``, then the MUA SHOULD
expose the UI in an inactive state.  But if the user chooses to
activate it (e.g., clicking on the checkbox), then the UI should
display a warning to the user and ask them to confirm the choice to
encrypt.

.. _preference-ui:

Account Preferences
+++++++++++++++++++

Level 1 MUAs SHOULD allow the user to disable Autocrypt completely for
each account they control (that is, to set ``accounts[addr].enabled``
to ``false``).  For level 1, we expect most MUAs to have Autocrypt
disabled by default. See :ref:`enabling-disabling` for more details.

.. _getting-started:

Helping Users get Started
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section provides recommendations for MUA implementations to help
users start Autocrypt immediately after an account (with the address
``addr``) was set up.

The MUA SHOULD scan the mailbox for messages sent by the user
(wherever the messages might be) that show evidence of OpenPGP or
Autocrypt usage. It is likely sufficient to only scan the messages
sent during the last 30 days, as it is unlikely that the user
used Autocrypt or OpenPGP actively if no such message was sent in
the recent past.

From the set of all found sent messages, the MUA should
determine the best action to take from the following list of choices.
Earlier choices are better than later ones.

1. If an Autocrypt Setup Message was found:

   Start a setup process suggesting the user to import the
   setup message. If multiple Autocrypt Setup Messages are
   found, the most recent message should be preferred.

2. If a sent message with an Autocrypt header was found:

   Provide guidance for creating an Autocrypt Setup Message
   on the MUA that created the message.

3. If there is evidence of actively used OpenPGP software
   (for example if a secret key is available, some
   specific software is installed, etc.) or if encrypted
   mails are found:

   Inform the user about Autocrypt on <https://autocrypt.org/pgp-users>.

4. If no evidence for Autocrypt was found:

   Create a key with default settings and without a password in the
   background. Set your ``accounts[addr].prefer_encrypt`` to
   ``nopreference`` and start sending Autocrypt headers.

.. _enabling-disabling:

Disabling Autocrypt
+++++++++++++++++++

Once Autocrypt is enabled for a given account
(``accounts[addr].enabled`` is set to ``true``), the user might choose
to disable it.  By default, disabling should only set
``accounts[addr].enabled`` to ``false``, and it SHOULD NOT destroy
``accounts[addr].secret_key``.  This preserves the user's ability to
read old encrypted e-mails, as well as being able to read encrypted
e-mails that arrive after the user has disabled Autocrypt.

The act of re-enabling Autocrypt after it was disabled SHOULD leave
``accounts[addr].secret_key`` and ``accounts[addr].public_key``
intact, so that the user continues using the same key.

.. _`destroy-secret-key`:

Destroying Secret Key Material
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When disabling Autocrypt for an account, a Level 1 MUA MAY offer the
user an opportunity to also destroy the secret key material for that
account.  Since Autocrypt clients generally do not discuss secret keys
with users, a MUA offering this choice should use a phrase like
"destroy access to encrypted messages", rather than referring to
"keys" or "key material".

A MUA that allows the user this opportunity SHOULD clearly indicate to
the user that the destruction of this secret key material will leave
them unable to read any new messages that arrive encrypted.  A MUA
that only retains the encrypted form of archived messages SHOULD also
indicate to the user that previously-received encrypted messages will
become unreadable as well.  Note that for some users, this is a
desirable feature: "destroy all messages" is an appropriate action to
take in some circumstances.

If the user selects this option, the MUA MUST clear both
``accounts[addr].secret_key`` and ``accounts[addr].public_key``.

Appendix
--------

.. _`address-canonicalization`:

E-mail Address Canonicalization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To keep consistent state referring to different but practically equivalent
writings of an e-mail address, a MUA SHOULD canonicalize e-mail
addresses when comparing them (for example for using an e-mail
address as an index key).

Canonicalizing the domain part (the part after the ``@``): A MUA SHOULD canonicalize the domain part using :rfc:`IDNA2008 Punycode conversion to ASCII <5891#section-4.4>`.

Canonicalizing the local part (the part before the ``@``):
Autocrypt-capable MUAs that encounter a peer's e-mail address where
the local part appears to be valid UTF-8 SHOULD canonicalize the local
part by making it all lower-case using the "empty" locale (see `W3C's
discussion on Case folding
<https://www.w3.org/International/wiki/Case_folding>`_ for more
details).

:rfc:`SMTP specifications <5321#section-2.3.11>` say the local part
is technically domain-specific, and byte-for-byte arbitrarily
sensitive. In practice, nearly every e-mail domain treats the local
part of the address as a case-insensitive string.  That is, while it
is permitted by the standards, ``John@example.org`` is very unlikely
to deliver to a different mailbox than ``john@example.org``.

An Autocrypt-capable MUA that is configured to use an account that has
an e-mail address whose local part is not a valid UTF-8 string, or who
cannot receive mail at the canonicalized form of their associated
address SHOULD NOT enable Autocrypt on that e-mail account without an
additional warning to the user.

Other canonicalization efforts are considered for later specification
versions.

.. _example-headers:

Example Autocrypt headers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Alice sends Bob a simple, unencrypted e-mail message that lets Bob
write back encrypted if Bob is using an Autocrypt-enabled MUA:

.. literalinclude:: appendix/example-simple-autocrypt.eml
    :language: none


.. _autocrypt-gossip-example:

Example Autocrypt Gossip headers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After having received messages with Autocrypt headers from both Bob
and Carol, Alice sends an e-mail to the two of them, with Autocrypt
Gossip headers.

.. literalinclude:: appendix/example-gossip.eml
    :language: none

Since Alice encrypts messages to herself, the above message can be
decrypted by her private key as well (see the
:ref:`setup-message-example` for access to her private key)

When decrypted, the encrypted part contains:

.. literalinclude:: appendix/example-gossip-cleartext.eml
    :language: none

.. _example-cant-encrypt-reply:

Example Copy when a Reply can't be Encrypted
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: none

    The message this is a reply to was sent encrypted, but this reply is
    unencrypted because I don't yet know how to encrypt to
    ``bob@example.com``.  If ``bob@example.com`` would reply here, my
    future messages in this thread will be encrypted.


.. _example-setup-code:

Example User Interaction for Setup Message Creation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Setup Code shown in this example can be used with
:ref:`setup-message-example` below.

.. code-block:: none

    You'll need to use this Setup Code in your other e-mail app to use
    the Autocrypt Setup Message:

        1742-0185-6197-
        1303-7016-8412-
        3581-4441-0597


Example User Interaction for Setup Message Receipt
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To initiate the import of the Autocrypt Setup Message, the MUA
can display a message like the example below:

.. code-block:: none

    ExampleMail has detected an Autocrypt Setup Message created by one
    of the other apps you use to access "alice@autocrypt.example".  By
    importing the settings from this message, you can start using
    Autocrypt here in ExampleMail too!

    Please enter the Setup Code displayed by your other e-mail app to
    proceed:

                     17__ - ____ - ____ -
                     ____ - ____ - ____ -
                     ____ - ____ - ____


               [   Cancel   ]     [ Import Settings ]

.. _setup-message-example:

Example Setup Message
+++++++++++++++++++++

Alice's MUA sends her a Setup Message after showing her a Setup Code
(the code used here is the one from :ref:`example-setup-code`).  The
generated message looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: appendix/example-setup-message.eml
    :language: none

When decrypted with the Setup Code, the encrypted blob at the end
contains:

.. literalinclude:: appendix/example-setup-message-cleartext.key
    :language: none

Example Stored Draft
++++++++++++++++++++

Alice composes a message to Bob, and manually chooses to encrypt in
her MUA's UI. She does not send the message immediately, but stores it
in a drafts folder. The message is encrypted (but not signed), and its
encryption-related state is saved in the Autocrypt-Draft-Header (see
:ref:`autocrypt-draft-state`). The encrypted payload also contains
Bob's key as an Autocrypt-Gossip header, to ensure encryption is
possible when the message is picked up.

.. literalinclude:: appendix/example-draft.eml
    :language: none

The encrypted payload contains:

.. literalinclude:: appendix/example-draft-cleartext.eml
    :language: none
