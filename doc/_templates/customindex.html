        <h2>Open Standard</h2>
        <p>
          Autocrypt is an open specification for e-mail encryption.
          Under the hood, it uses OpenPGP and other e-mail standards.

    <h2>What is Autocrypt?</h2>
    <p>
      Autocrypt is a set of guidelines for convenient
      end-to-end-encryption of e-mails. Developers are working on
      bringing it to several different e-mail programs.
    </p>
    <h2>Technical Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Autocrypt is a specification that allows e-mail clients to negotiate
        end-to-end encryption, transparently piggybacking on plaintext e-mails.
        The goal is to offer single-click opt-in encryption when the user asks
        for it, but otherwise stay out of their way as much as possible.
    </p>
    <h2>Does it already work?</h2>
    <p>
      The first specification, <a href="{{ pathto('level1') }}">Level 1</a>,
      was released in December 2017. A few mail programs are already capable
      of Autocrypt, some want to be in Spring 2018.
