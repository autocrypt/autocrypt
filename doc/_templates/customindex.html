    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We believe that surveillance is bad for a free society. Not only governments, but also big corporations are spying on as every day, taking our rights away piece by piece. We believe that people should be able to communicate privately, without censorship, independent from the powerful, decentralized, with software they can trust.</p>
    <p>Until now, it was way too hard to encrypt communication. Either you had to install a messenger none of your friends used, or you had to be a crypto expert (which already beats the rocket science metaphor). With autocrypt, you can finally communicate with everyone who has an E-Mail address, and encrypt automatically with other autocrypt users.</p>
