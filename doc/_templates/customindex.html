        <h2>Open Standard</h2>
        <p>
          Autocrypt is an open standard for e-mail encryption.
          Under the hood, it uses OpenPGP and other e-mail standards.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Autocrypt aims to provide end-to-end encrypted e-mail that is
      convenient enough for wide adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
      End-to-end encrypted e-mail has been around for decades, but has
      failed to see wide adoption outside of specialist communities.
      Through strengthening the e-mail ecosystem step-by-step, we want
      to increase user autonomy and privacy for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Autocrypt effort is driven by a diverse group of mail app developers, hackers and researchers who are willing to take fresh approaches, learn from past mistakes, and collectively aim to increase the overall end-to-end encryption of e-mail in the net.
