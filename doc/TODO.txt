Setup Message:

- do a PR motivating the prefer-encrypt=mutual before diving into the
  details of it (azul, oliver)

- move "input-type" from Autocrypt-Setup-Message header to
  a header of the PGP secret key, maybe "Passphrase-Format"
  (azul, oliver) #80

- #81 refining/fixating the symmetric "setup code" encryption and Setup Message format
  (defending particularly against secret-key-injection because if we let the user
  go through the effort of transfering 128 bit of entropy out-of-band we should try
  hard to protect a MITM exchanging keys)  (discussion based on a PR?)
  three known solutions:
  - mandate exact PGP message
  - put and verify Setup Code in the decrypted cleartext of the Setup Message
  - just say "the message MUST be decrypted using the Setup Code" and
    rely on people calling their engines/APIs correctly and note that particularly
    gpg might appear to have decrypted symmetricatally but did something else

  -> at least improve the baseline along the last/third bullet point
  see issue #81

- gossiping keys
  (vincent, holger)

- #82 Phase in new keys  (ed25559)
  consider using type=0 and type=1 instead of "p" etc.

- alphanumeric versus number "setup codes" (discussion)
  and also consider error-correction
