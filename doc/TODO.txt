open issues:

- include own prefer-encrypt setting in the autocrypt setup message
  so that the other client can start off from the "imported" prefer-encrypt
  setting (so e.g. a "mutual" setting carries over and will not lead to
  flip-flopping when sending mails to third parties which means that the
  other client will flip-flop the "encrypt" checkbox (if it has one))
  (Bjoern, PR)

- fix own state MUST (PR, vincent)

- move "pah" attributes (parsed autocrypt header) to "peerstate"
  and "update internal state" section at least somewhat
  (remove TODOs, ...) (vincent, patrick, PR)

Setup Message:

- refine "must"/"should" wording on "setup code" (PR, dkg)

- User ID does not need to match an email (it's "decorative") (PR, holger)

- alphanumeric versus number "setup codes" (discussion)
  and also consider error-correction

- refining/fixating the symmetric "setup code" encryption and Setup Message format
  (defending particularly against secret-key-injection because if we let the user
  go through the effort of transfering 128 bit of entropy out-of-band we should try
  hard to protect a MITM exchanging keys)  (discussion based on a PR?)
  two known solutions:
  - mandate exact PGP message
  - put and verify Setup Code in the decrypted cleartext of the Setup Message
  - just say "the message MUST be decrypted using the Setup Code" and
    rely on people calling their engines/APIs correctly and note that particularly
    gpg might appear to have decrypted symmetricatally but did something else
