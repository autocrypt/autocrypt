Introducing Autocrypt: Email Encryption for Everyone
====================================================

**If users ask how they can secure their email the answer
should be as simple as: use an Autocrypt-enabled mail app!**

**Why improve email?** Email has been declared dead many times but 
refuses to die. It remains the largest open federated identity and
messaging eco-system, anchors the web, mobiles and continues to relay
sensitive information between citizens and organisations. It has
problems but do you prefer the proprietary, easy-to-track mobile phone 
number system to become the single source of digital identification?

**Why a new approach to email encryption?**  Encrypted email has been
around for decades, but has failed to see wide adoption outside of
specialist communities, in large part because of difficulties with user
experience and certification models.  Autocrypt first aims to provide 
convenient encryption that is neither perfect nor as secure as 
traditional email encryption, but is convenient enough for
much wider adoption.  

The social Autocrypt approach
------------------------------

The Autocrypt project is driven by a diverse group mail of app developers, 
hackers and researchers who are willing to take fresh approaches, learn from
past mistakes, and collectively aim to increase the overall encryption
of email in the net.  The group effort was born and named "Autocrypt"
on December 17th 2016 by ~20 people during a 5-day meeting at the 
OnionSpace in Berlin. It's a dynamic, fun process which is open to 
new people, influences and contributions.  See :doc:`contact channels
and upcoming events <contact>` on how you may talk with us and who
"we" are currently.


The technical Autocrypt approach
--------------------------------------

Autocrypt uses existing email messages between people to transfer 
the necessary information to allow encrypting subsequent messages.  
Under the hood, Autocrypt uses email headers for this information
transfer. By default, no key management should be visible to the users.
See :doc:`features` for more highlights.

We are establishing this approach step-by-step using different "Levels"
of implementation compliance.  We are currently documenting :doc:`Level
0 <level0>`, which we aim to see supported in Spring of 2017 by various
mailers.

See :doc:`contents` for an index of all docs and discussion results so far.
