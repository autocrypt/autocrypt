Autocrypt User Experience
=========================

Autocrypt aims to provide users with the same user experience they
have with their normal e-mail.

The main change we expect users to notice is that they will only be
able to read any e-mail encrypted to then when using a single
Autocrypt-enabled device or app.  However, not all mail will be
encrypted.

During the initial rollout, we do not expect most e-mails to be
encrypted.  Rather, only mails that are deliberately encrypted by the
sender will be unreadable on webmail or non-Autocrypt clients.  In a
near future `level of implementation <levels.html>`_, users will be
able to read mail from *any* e-mail app that is Autocrypt-enabled, not
just one.

E-mail encryption will inevitably involve some specific configuration,
but the most we expect a normal user to see will be a single button
when composing outbound e-mail that allows the user to encrypt the
existing message.  Some apps might not even have that.

If you are an implementer, please see `the Level 0 UI
guidance <level0/user-interface.html>`_ for more details.
