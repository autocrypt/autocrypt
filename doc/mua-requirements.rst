Requirements for Mail User Agents to be Autocrypt compatible
============================================================

Multidevice
-----------

In order to access your email from different devices they need access to a shared mail store

Your MUA needs the ability to:
 * Create folders of arbitrary names
 * Write to folders of arbitrary names
 * Read from folders of arbitrary names
