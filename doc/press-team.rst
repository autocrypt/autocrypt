Autocrypt Press Team Policy
===========================

The Autocrypt Press Team handles mail sent to press@autocrypt.org,
which we expect to be press inquiries. This document tries to describe
how we handle mail to and from this alias.

Don't hide who is responsible for press@autocrypt.org
-----------------------------------------------------

Everyone in the project (including anyone lurking) should know who is on
the press team.  This doesn't have to be published in some formal place
(though it could be), but if anyone wants to know it shouldn't be a
secret.  We don't need anyone's legal names, but if you participate in
Autocrypt under some nick, you should be OK with people knowing that
that nick is part of the press team.

Always reply from your own specific e-mail address
--------------------------------------------------

When replying to an e-mail that was sent to press@autocrypt.org, members
of the press team should reply from their own address, so everyone can
tell who is having the conversation.

Don't send new mail from the alias
----------------------------------

This alias is for inbound contacts, and shouldn't be used to send
new messages that aren't a reply.

Always Cc press@autocrypt.org when replying
-------------------------------------------

To ensure that active participants can know what's been answered and
what's going on, everyone who responds to mail that was sent to
press@autocrypt.org should respond with press@autocrypt.org in Cc.

Maintain an archive of messages sent to press@autocrypt.org
-----------------------------------------------------------

Messages sent to press@autocrypt.org should be stored in a read-only
mailbox that is accessible to the current "press team", in addition to
being forwarded to the recipients.  Messages should be deleted from the
archive after 6 months.

Someone should reply within a day
---------------------------------

If this is going to be a useful address for press inquiries, we also
need to try to have *someone* answer legitimate messages within 24 hours.

   How do we guarantee this? suggestions welcome.

Ask if you want to be on the team
---------------------------------

If you want to help take responsibility for the press team, ask the
existing press team.  Anyone on the existing press team should be able
to add you to it if you're an active member of the project.

Propose fixes to this policy
----------------------------

If something is wrong with this policy, propose a fix the way you'd
propose a fix to the Autocrypt spec.
