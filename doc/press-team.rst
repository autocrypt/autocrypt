Autocrypt press team
====================

If you have any press-related inquiries please send e-mail to
the `press-team <mailto:press-team@autocrypt.org>`_, The press team
strives to answer within two workdays on press-related inquiries,
and often will get back faster (we have a knack for e-mail).

This document describes our practises how we handle and account for
press communications.

Accountability of press-team
-----------------------------------------------------------

If the press-team becomes aware of reporting, it will usually send
a link of press articles to the community mailing list.  The press-team is
accountable in that anyone can ask how media reporting came about and
how and who, if anyone, was involved from the press-team.  Note that
often journalists do not ask back before they publish articles, or do
not even contact a project before reporting.


If you want to be on the team
-----------------------------

If you want to help, ask the existing press team. Anyone on the
existing press team may add you if you're an active member of the
project. Press team members don't need to formally publish their nicks
or names (though they can), but they are not considered a secret.
Providing legal names is not required. Nicks are sufficient.

Communication and reply practises
----------------------------------

When replying to an e-mail that was sent to the press-team, members
of the press team reply from their personal e-mail address, so everyone can
tell who is replying to and having the conversation. They will typically
Cc the press-team at least on the initial reply so that the others know the
communication is handled. If a conversation moved off to phone-calls,
interviews, or private e-mail, then press members typically send a brief
summary note to the other team members. Note that the press-team alias
e-mail address is only used for inbound contacts, and shouldn't be used to
send new messages that aren't a reply.
