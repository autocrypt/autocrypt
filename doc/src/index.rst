Autocrypt Python Reference tool and implementation
==================================================

.. note::

    The autocrypt reference tool is as much in development
    as the spec itself.  Until we have a 1.0 release
    everything is subject to change.

Installation
------------

You need the python package installer "pip".  If you
don't have it you can install it on Debian systems::

    sudo apt-get install python-pip

And now you can install the autocrypt package::

    pip install --user autocrypt

And then make sure that ``~/.local/bin`` is contained
in your ``PATH`` variable.
