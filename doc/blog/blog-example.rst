Share your experiences with autocrypt!
======================================

*A guest post by b3yond, on 2017-11-05.*

Many IT people are a bit afraid of writing blog posts. There are no
clear rules on how to do it, you can't look up how the standard is,
and copy-pasting is *discouraged* by societal norms of intellectual
property.

There is no reason to be afraid though! We all have weird thoughts,
and we all want to know what stuff other people are thinking. We want
to share experiences, knowledge and some stupid proposal which
probably will not work anyway.

So get your thoughts on paper!
------------------------------

Surely you have something in your mind which is worth sharing with
the world, so people can learn more about autocrypt. Just write it
down in rst format, and submit it to mailto:guest-blog@autocrypt.org,
so we can review and publish it.

Thanks!

Publishing a blogpost
---------------------

If the guest post is fine so far and should be published on the
website, take these steps:

* save it as name.rst in
  https://github.com/autocrypt/autocrypt/tree/master/doc/blog, be
  careful that the filename is no duplicate
* put the title and the first paragraph + link with "read more..." in
  news.rst
* spread the article on mailing list & social media

Fine, now the article is public!
