Upcoming events
---------------

- December 27-30th 2017, Leipzig: 34th Chaos Communication Congress.
  Several Autocrypters will be present.  Look out for self-organized
  Autocrypt and/or Delta.Chat sessions.

- January 10-12th 2018: RealWorldCrypto, Zuerich. A few Autocrypters
  might go, maybe also try to give a Lightning talk, certainly have
  side-discussions like last year.

- January 17th 2018, Lausanne, Switzerland: a day of discussions and
  interchange with researchers from EPFL and the NEXTLEAP EU project
  on out-of-band verification and key gossip, also in relation
  to Autocrypt.

- March 2018: Internet Freedom Festival, Valencia. We proposed
  two usability sessions and several Autocrypt-related folks
  aim to appear in Valencia. It's unclear at this point if we
  go for a pre- or post-gathering like we did in 2017.
